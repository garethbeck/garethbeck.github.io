						<h2>What is SEO trying to do?</h2>

    <p>I was asked recently in a RFI: ‘Out of platform, technical and authority, which one has the most impact?’. Not an unreasonable question but one that to my mind, misunderstands what SEO is.</p>

<p>My initial thought was “Well, it depends”. I made the point if anyone of those things is really out of balance then that’s the one that matters for that site, at that time.</p>

<p>Back in the 2000’s my flatmate worked at Snow and Rock and used to bring back loads of mountain bike magazines, an article where a mountain bike journalist raced the current world downhill champion really stuck with me.</p>

<p>What was interesting wasn’t that the interviewer lost (which he did by a substantial margin), but his reasoning as to why he lost.</p>

<h2 id="why-he-thought-he-lost">Why he thought he lost</h2>

<p>There wasn’t one thing that the champion was much, much better at. He was slightly better at everything:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Better line going into corners,</li>
  <li>Better at keeping pedalling (apparently he never stopped),</li>
  <li>Lower on the jumps,</li>
  <li>and a ton of other technical things that I’ve forgotten.</li>
  <li>Over the course of the race, the cumulative effect of all the small margins meant that he won 20 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters.</h2>
<p>When I read this I didn’t do SEO (it was over 15 yrs ago), but it stuck with me. I think this was because it was such a clear demonstration that no matter what you are doing there isn’t a big shiny button that will make you better than everyone else: there isn’t one thing that you can practice that will mean you win.</p>

<p>You need to optimise everything.</p>

<p>The RFI made me think I was being obtuse and deliberately vague, but I answered “It depends on the site”, because in most cases, it really does.</p>
